Surwish OS for Miyoo Flip
=============================

**Surwish OS** is a feature-rich custom operating system for the **Miyoo Flip**, designed to bring the handheld experience up to par with the best-in-class systems.

While the Flip's stock OS provides a lightweight and smooth foundation, it lacks many advanced features and polish found in other modern handheld firmwares. Surwish OS builds upon this solid base and adds a wealth of improvements --- making the Flip not just usable, but exceptional.

🛠️ Behind the Scenes
---------------------

Surwish OS is not a simple mod --- it's a **ground-up rework**:

-   CrossMix OS served as a technical base, but adapting it to the Flip required **full rewrites** due to different paths, resolutions, and emulator configs.

-   All emulator configs were **tuned for the Flip's resolution and performance**, including aspect ratio fixes, shader integration, and input calibration.

-   **Testing and debugging** was done to ensure smooth performance across platforms and compatibility with both RetroArch and standalone emulators.

-   Firmware work included testing **audio over Bluetooth**, lid-close events, and overall system stability.
